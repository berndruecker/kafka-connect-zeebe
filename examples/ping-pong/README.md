# Ping Pong

This is a very simple example to showcase the interaction between Zeebe and Kafka using Kafka Connect
and the Zeebe source and sink connectors, using the following process:

![Process](process.png)

When an instance of this process is created, the service task `To Kafka` will be activated by the
source connector `ping`, which will publish a record on the topic `pong`. That record will have
the job key as its key, and as value the job itself serialized to JSON.

The `pong` sink connector will consume records from the `pong` topic, and publish a message to
its Zeebe broker. For example, given the following record published to `pong` on partition 1,
at offset 1, and with the following value:

```json
{
  "name": "pong",
  "key": 1,
  "payload": {
    "foo": "bar"
  },
  "ttl": 10000,
  ...
}
```

It will publish the following message to Zeebe:

```json
{
  "name": "pong",
  "correlationKey": 1,
  "timeToLive": 10000,
  "messageId": "pong:1:1",
  "variables": {
    "foo": "bar"
  }
}
```

If you inspect the instance in Operate, you will see that it should be completed, and `foo` will now
be a top level variable.

## Prerequisites

* Install and run Kafka, Kafka Connect and Zeebe as described [here](https://github.com/zeebe-io/kafka-connect-zeebe/tree/master/examples#setup)

## Running the example

The simplest way to run through it is to use the provided `Makefile`. If that's not an
option on your system, then you can run all the steps manually.


### Makefile

> To use the `Makefile` you will also need [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/).

Running `make` deploy all resources, and create a single workflow instance. Broken down into steps:

#### Deploy workflow and connectors

```shell
make workflow source sink
```

#### Create an instance

To create the instance, run:

```shell
make ping
```
### Manually

If `make` is not available on your system then you can run steps manually:

#### Deploy workflow

```shell
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec zeebe \
  zbctl create instance --variables "{\"name\": \"pong\", \"payload\": { \"foo\": \"bar\"}, \"key\": 1}" ping-pong
```

#### Deploy connectors

If `curl` is not available, you can also use [Control Center](http://localhost:9021) to create the connectors.
Make sure to configure them according to the following properties: [source connector properties](source.json), [sink connector properties](sink.json)

Now create the source connector:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @examples/ping-pong/source.json http://localhost:8083
```

Next, create the sink connector:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @examples/ping-pong/sink.json http://localhost:8083
```

#### Create a workflow instance

We can now create a workflow instance:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec zeebe \
	zbctl create instance --variables "{\"name\": \"pong\", \"payload\": { \"foo\": \"bar\"}, \"key\": 1}" ping-pong
```

Replace the value of the key variable to change the correlation key.
